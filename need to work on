#add another while loop here for citizenship status, YES will move on to voter choices, NO will reject and start from the top ar enter your age (Still need to figure out how to have it go back to the very top at enter your age....) and either we can have it that it check for YES or Yes, or any variation of the capitalization, or more simpler is just have all input be mandated in caps lock. To undertsand the OR operator, google it.
